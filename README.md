# Airline-Flights-Delay-Prediction
Airline Flights Delay Prediction

This is the final class project for my CSE 158 (Recommender Systems and Web Mining) taken at UCSD.
The goal of the project is open ended but we have to use a dataset with more than 50,000 data entries.
The project primarily focuses on the key factors contributing to whether a flight will be delayed. The dataset we chose came from Department of Transportation Year 2015 Flights Information across the United States. Within our model selections, we proposed several potentially useful models such as Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, etc. Given all the modelsâ€™ performances, we decided that Decision Tree would be the best model because it has the second highest accuracy score and the best F1 score.
